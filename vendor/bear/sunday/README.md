## What's BEAR.Sunday

This resource orientated framework has both externally and internally
 a **REST centric architecture**,  implementing **Dependency Injection** and
**Aspect Orientated Programming** heavily to offer you surprising
simplicity,  order and flexibility in your application. With very
 few components of its own, it is a fantastic example of how a framework
 can be built using  existing components and libraries from other
frameworks, yet offer even further benefit and beauty.

## Because everything is a resource

In BEAR.Sunday **everything is a REST resource** which leads to far simpler design and extensibility.
Interactions with your database, services and even pages and sections of your app all sit comfortably in a resource which can be consumed or rendered at will.
